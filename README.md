### install script up next


#### these files are wpg templates, use wpg -ta /path/to/file to add:

```
~/.config/dunst/dunstrc
~/.config/dunst/dunst.mini
~/.config/kitty/kitty_colors.conf
~/.config/polybar/config
~/.config/qutebrowser/config.py
~/.config/rofi/config.rasi
~/.local/share/localweb/startpage/index.html
~/.local/share/localweb/startpage/script/script.js
~/.local/share/localweb/startpage/style/style.css
```

the files in the .config/wpg/templates folder are backups, don't copy them (probably shouldn't have included them)


#### meme login screen
`sudo cp /path/drake_navy_issue /etc/issue`


#### a list of all my packages can be found in /etc so you have an idea for dependencies until I finish the install script
##### not featured on that list is dmenu & sxiv (you need sxiv, dmenu is just there for nostalgia), I run custom builds of these but the standard bins will work fine.



old i3 config can still be found on a different branch, most of the stuff in it has been transfered to this (some stuff improved).
